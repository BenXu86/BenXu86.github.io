I am currently a second-year master student at Nankai University(Tianjin, China) majoring in 
computer science and advised by [Prof.Bo Ren](http://ren-bo.net). 

I received my B.S. degree from Nankai University(Tianjin, China)
in 2019. I will receive my master degree in 2022. 

My research interests lie in physical simulation, more specifically, fluid modeling and scientific computing. 
I believe that reproduce nature in the computer will be an important tool for mankind to explore unknown areas in the future.
