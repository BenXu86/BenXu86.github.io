I am currently a second-year master student at Nankai University(Tianjin, China) majoring in 
computer science and advised by [Prof.Bo Ren](http://ren-bo.net). 

I received my B.S. degree from Nankai University(Tianjin, China)
in 2019. I will receive my master degree in 2022. Now I am actively looking for overseas PhD programs.

My research interests lie in physical simulation, more specifically, fluid modeling and scientific computing. 
I am addicted to recreating the beauty of nature, developing more efficient numerical method to help people better understand the real physical world. Simulation is the key.

Here is my [CV](https://github.com/BenXu86/DataSet/raw/main/xuben_cv.pdf).
