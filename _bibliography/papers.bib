  title={Unified Particle System for Multiple-fluid Flow in Porous Material},
  author={Bo Ren* and Ben Xu* and Chenfeng Li},
  abstract={Porous materials are common in daily life. They include granular material (e.g. sand) that behaves like liquid flow when mixed with fluid and foam material (e.g. sponge) that deforms like solid when interacting with liquid. The underlying physics is further complicated when multiple fluids interact with porous materials involving coupling between rigid and fluid bodies, who may follow different governing equations such as the Darcyâ€™s law or the multiple-fluid Navier-Stokes equations. We propose a unified particle model for the simulation of multiple-fluid flows and porous materials. A novel virtual phase concept is introduced to avoid explicit particle state tracking and runtime particle deletion/insertion. Our unified model is flexible and stable to cope with multiple fluid interacting with porous materials, and it can ensure consistent mass and momentum transport over the whole simulation space.},
